# About me
I am a Post Doctoral Research Associate at the  <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/geographic-data-science/">**Geographic Data Science Lab**</a> of the <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/">**University of Liverpool**</a>. 

My research lies at the intersection of **data science**, **geography** and **urban planning**. I am particularly interested in exploring the social and everyday character of places to inform urban planning solutions. 

I hold a PhD in Computer Science awarded jointly by the [University of Torino](http://www.di.unito.it/do/home.pl) and [University of Luxembourg](https://wwwen.uni.lu/snt). I have a markedly interdisciplinary background spanning political science, geography and statistics.

I have been member of the European Network Exploring Research into Geospatial Information Crowdsourcing: software and methodologies for harnessing geographic information from the crowd [ENERGIC](http://vgibox.eu/).

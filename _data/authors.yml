  about: |
    I am Lecturer in Sustainability and Urban Data Science at the [**Edinburgh Futures Institute**](https://efi.ed.ac.uk/) and the [**Edinburgh School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture**](https://www.eca.ed.ac.uk/edinburgh-school-architecture-and-landscape-architecture-esala) of the [**University of Edinburgh**](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). I am co-lead of the [**CHASS Research Theme** - *Future Cities*](https://www.ed.ac.uk/arts-humanities-soc-sci/research-ke/research-themes) and co-organiser of [**EdinbR**](http://edinbr.org/).

    My research sits at the intersection of Urban Planning, Geography and Computer Science and I am interested in developing new **spatially informed computational methods** to better understand the mutual relationship between human behaviours and their urban contexts. This work blends traditional and new forms of data to provide quantifiable **evidence of urban dynamics** and **inform policy making**. My current substantive focus concerns how we can **equitability manage Net Zero transitions within cities**.


    Previously, I was a Post Doctoral Research Associate at the  [**Geographic Data Science Lab**](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/geographic-data-science) of the [**University of Liverpool**](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/) and I hold a PhD in Computer Science awarded jointly by the [University of Torino](http://www.di.unito.it/do/home.pl) and [University of Luxembourg](https://wwwen.uni.lu/snt). 

    I have been member of the European Network Exploring Research into Geospatial Information Crowdsourcing software and methodologies for harnessing geographic information from the crowd [ENERGIC](http://vgibox.eu/).

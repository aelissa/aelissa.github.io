    I am Lecturer in Urban Data Science and Sustainability at the Edinburgh Future Institute and the School of Architecture and Lanscape Architecture (ESALA).

    My research sits at the intersection of Urban Planning, Geography and Computer Science and is interested in developing new spatially informed computational methods to better understand the mutual relationship between human behaviours and their urban contexts. This work blends traditional and new forms of data to provide quantifiable evidence of urban dynamics and inform policy making. My current substantive focus concerns how we can equitability manage Net Zero transitions within cities.
    Previously I was a Post Doctoral Research Associate at the  [**Geographic Data Science Lab**](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/geographic-data-science) of the [**University of Liverpool**](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/). 
    I hold a PhD in Computer Science awarded jointly by the [University of Torino](http://www.di.unito.it/do/home.pl) and [University of Luxembourg](https://wwwen.uni.lu/snt). I have a markedly interdisciplinary background spanning social science, geography and statistics.

    I have been member of the European Network Exploring Research into Geospatial Information Crowdsourcing software and methodologies for harnessing geographic information from the crowd [ENERGIC](http://vgibox.eu/).

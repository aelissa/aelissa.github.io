### Liveable Liverpool City Region: Active Travel and Liveable Neighbourhoods to support the Liverpool City Region’s post-COVID economic recovery - October 2020 - July 2021

The aim of this project is to expand collaborative links between the University of Liverpool (UoL) and the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority (LCRCA) to create a low carbon, inclusive and resilient city-region which supports the LCRCA’s post COVID-19 economic recovery. It will do this through support for policy analysis within LCR, focusing on LCRCA’s ability to use the Setting City Area Targets and Trajectories for Emissions Reduction tool in its decision making.

Specifically, the project will focus on possible LCRCA interventions related to:

1. Ongoing active travel activity in LCRCA made through Tranches 1&2 of the UK Government’s Emergency Active Travel Fund, which has, in broad terms, led to the creation of ‘pop up’ bike lanes. 
2. A scenario premised on the ’15-minute city’ – broadly put: all daily needs/services should be a maximum of a 15-minute walk/cycle from your house – currently popularised by the Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo.


### First Life - 2014 - 2018

[First  Life](www.firstlife.org) is  a  georeferenced  civic  social  network.  It  is  baseline  technology  for  several  projects.  I  was  specifically  involved  in  the  following:  

- [PIUMA](http://piuma.di.unito.it/), Personalized Interactive Urban Maps for Autism project aims at helping people with the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) move and live within cities by means of a new digital service that provides interactive personalized maps.
 
- [Food  Atlas](http://atlantedelcibo.it/),  a participatory mapping project of the Turin metropolitan city food system.

- [EsploraTo/TeenCarto](https://esplorato.teencarto.it), an action-research project carried out in Turin, which involved more than 600 teenagers from 16 high schools, in a massive process of community mapping aiming at producing a representation of their urban geography. Data collected has been analyzed to make evident the way teenagers use the city as well as how they imagine a better city.  

- [MiraMap](http://www.miramap.it/), carried out in the Mirafiori District, one of the deprived neighborhoods in Turin (Italy), our project leveraged on the social and economic transformative potential of the area. New methods and IT solutions have been experimented to facilitate citizens-city councillors interaction for the reporting and managing of issues and proposals concerning the area.
